Explanation:

We first import the `Scanner` class from the `java.util`
package to allow user input.

We create a `main` method which is the entry point of the 
program.

We prompt the user to enter a number using the 
`System.out.print()` method and read it using the `nextInt()` 
method of the `Scanner` class.

We initialize two variables `sum` and `digit` to store the sum 
of digits and the current digit respectively.

We use a `while` loop to iterate through each digit of the given number. 
We continue looping until the number becomes 
0.

Inside the loop, we use the modulus operator `%` to extract 
the last digit of the number and store it in the `digit` variable. 
We then add this digit to the `sum` variable.

We update the value of the `number` variable by dividing it by 
10, which removes the last digit from the number.

After the loop ends, we print the sum of digits using the 
`System.out.println()` method.
